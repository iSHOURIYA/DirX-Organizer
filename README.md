# DirX Organizer  

**DirX Organizer** is an automatic file organization tool designed for Ubuntu. It sorts files in your **Downloads** folder into categorized subdirectories, making it easier to manage your files without manual intervention.

It consists of two main scripts:  
- **`dirx.sh`**: Moves files into appropriate folders (e.g., Documents, Images, Videos, etc.).  
- **`watcher.sh`**: Monitors the Downloads folder and automatically triggers the file organization process as new files are added.
